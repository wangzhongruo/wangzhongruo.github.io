== About me
I am a Phd candidate in ([http://appliedmath.ucdavis.edu/ GGAM]) at UC Davis. I am lucky working with [https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/ Shiqian Ma] and [https://sites.google.com/view/kriznakumar/home Krishnakumar Balasubramanian].

# I am also working with Lingzhou Xue, Bingyuan Liu and [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/R_Bradley R.Mark Bradley]

== Research
My research interests include
- Stochastic optimization, especially zeroth order optimization with variance reduction
- Zeroth order min-max optimization in deterministic case and stochastic case
- Policy optimization, policy gradient methods

== Publications
. Improved Zeroth-Order Algorithms for Nonconvex Saddle-Point Optimization (with Shiqian Ma and Zhongruo Wang)([https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09524 Arxiv])
. Manifold Proximal Linear Methods for Sparse Spectral Clustering with Application to Single-Cell Data Analysis(with Binyuan Liu, Shiqian Ma, Linzhou Xue)([https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07819 Arxiv])
